    <h2>WHAT IS FINAL FANTASY</h2>

    <div class="FF">
        <p>
        <br>
        Final Fantasy is a Japanese Role Playing, also known as a JRPG, game franchise created by Square Enix.
        The First game released in Japan in 1987 and was created by Hironboi Sagaguchi.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was never intended to be a franchise but the first game did so well that the company decided to make another.
        The next game was not a direct sequal to the first but introduced a whole new story and content but was still a JRPG style game and retained the title Final Fantasy .
        <br>
        <br>
        After that a new game was released almost every year with a new number after it and Final Fantasy has become one of the biggest JRPG game franchise in the world.
