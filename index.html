    <p>Let me tell you a bit about myself first.</p>
    <p>My ultimate passion in life is video games and one of my favourite franchise is the series Final Fantasy.
       It all began when I got my Sega Mega Drive when I was 7 with The Lion King and it sparked my interest in Video Games.
       I kept on with education though until I was in my teens when I was introduced to a franchise known as Final Fantasy and I was instantly hooked.
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>It all started in 1999 with Final Fantasy 8 on the Playstation and after completing that I heard there was more games so I sought them out and started playing them.
        As time grew on throughout different machines I can say I have bought multiple of the same games for different platforms. Now I am PC Master Race and now have all
        FF core games on the PC.
    </p>
    <p>I can honestly say I have completed most of the core games and even some of the side games. I can say though without a doubt that Final Fantasy is my ultimate passion.
        On this site I will mainly be focusing writing content for Final Fantasy.
    </p>
    <p>Apart from Final Fantasy I do enjoy the odd other games. Survival is one of my other enjoyments and Trading Card Games are something I enjoy on the side but not as much.
       For now I will be focusing on Final Fantasy since that's what I'm playing the most at the moment.
